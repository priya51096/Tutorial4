## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r Figref,fig.cap= "this is random noise"}

x = seq(1:100)
y = rnorm(100)
dat = data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_line()

```


# “Learning to reference tables”

```{r, NAME}
table <- dat %>% head(5)

knitr::kable(
table[1:5,], booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table of the first 5 rows of the COVID19 data')


```
In Table \@ref(tab:NAME) the first five rows of the data set are diplayed



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
